# Delta Robot Kinematic design

## Description
Basic pre-design mapping of delta robot workspace given span and length of each arm and fore-arm links.
## Insallation
- Set up matplotlib in python env
- Run the thing

## Diagrams

Complete model of possible range of motion as well as working space area.

Following Design modeling:
- Find appropraite workspace requirement
- Simulate possible range of motion using forward kinematic equation by 3 spheres intersection system
- Develop inverse kinematic and testing using forward kinematic equation
- Live Testing
